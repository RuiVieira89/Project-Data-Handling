        /*The Project Manager is responsible for creating a -- time-based plan -- , 
        to show when the project will be delivered and the key activities. 
        They will usually be required to also produce a budget plan as well 
        to show when major project costs will be incurred. After these documents 
        have been presented to the Project Board and signed off, keep a baseline 
        copy of these in the Archive sub-folders.*/

        /*For most simple to moderate projects, you can develop a simple Gantt chart 
        in Excel or use the Action Review Meeting (ARM) Template approach to drive progress.*/

        /*The project plan should be broken down into individual work packages known as a 
        work breakdown structure (WBS)*/


100-Work-Packages

    /*The Project Manager is responsible for dividing the project into sensible sized Work Packages. 
    These can be thought of as mini-projects. Each work package may be contracted to a different 
    supplier and allocated to a different manager or team in house.*/

    /*I recommend that you create a subfolders for each work package and follow the file name convention 

    -->    WBS-year-month-projectNumber-workPackageNumber-Descriptive_Name
    
    */

    /*Treat each work package like a mini project and make sure the requirements (set in pre project) 
    are clearly captured and managed through a change management process. The work package should 
    include success criteria and QA for example.*/


150-QA-Integration-Testing

    /*Integration -- holistic view of the part in the hole. Consequences of the changes*/

    /*Assuming each work package has been delivered to specification the project manager needs to ensure 
    that all the packages are integrated and work as a whole. For this reason, while we like to treat work
    packages as mini-projects, it is important that Work Package managers communicate with each other to 
    ensure that what they are doing is what the other package managers are expecting.*/

    /*When I run projects, I like to arrange what I call a smoke test, to test the integration of 
    all the work packages as early as possible. This is often possible before all the detailed work 
    on individual packages has been completed. Generally, in project management, the earlier in a 
    project you know about a problem, the cheaper it will be to fix.*/
